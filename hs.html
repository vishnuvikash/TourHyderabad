		<h3>Husain Sagar Lake</h3>
		<p>Situated just 2km away from the heart of the city, Hussain Sagar is one of the most popular tourist places in Hyderabad. The lake connects two parts of the city (Secunderabad and Hyderabad) to each other. The largest artificial lake in Asia, Hussain Sagar lake was excavated in 1562 AD during the reign of Ibrahim Quli Qutub Shah. Built on the tributary of River Musi, the lake has been named after Hussain Shah Wali. Hussain Sagar Lake was initially to build to cater to the irrigation needs and other water needs of the city. Until the year of 1930, it was used for the same purpose.

</p><p>Having been bordered by Indira Park in the east, Sanjeevaiah Park in the north and Lumbini Park in the south, the lake presents a setting quite rare to find in the middle of any city. There is also a bund on its banks, which was built to control the flow of water. This artificial lake now beautifies the city gracefully. Not just for beauty, it is also known for its historical connection. On the banks of this Hussain Sagar Lake the treaty between Mughals and Golconda was signed

At the middle of the lake, you will find a huge statue of standing Lord Buddha which has height of 16 m and weighs almost 350 tonnes. Made up of white granite, the statue is on the ‘Rock of Gibraltar’. The lighting show at the statue is something that is worth watching. Along with this,there are almost 30 statues of various famous personalities around the lake as well.

</p><p>A popular recreational spot, the Hussain Sagar Lake attracts visitors of all age groups. Whether a family picnic or outing with friends or your partner, this lake is visited by every Hyderabadi. Boating at the lake is quite enjoyable. There are various options of boating at Hussain Sagar Lake such as speed boats, motor boats, etc. Another major attraction of the lake is the 48 seater launch which also offer its guests with dinner as well as available for private parties if required. One can also do parasailing at Hussain Sagar Lake or water skiing, although the timings and availability of these activities do vary from time to time. Cruising at the lake makes the visit all the more enjoyable.
